hey, i'm adarsh and like you, i love building silly and useful products. previously, i have built Camb.ai and loved it to its core. we started it from grounds up all the way till we raised its seed round and met some of craziest ytbuers on the planet.  

currently i'm @ ZeroPath, making vibe coding secure and more. i'll be in sf for summer if anyone wants to meetup. 

if any of this sounds interesting, reachout.
